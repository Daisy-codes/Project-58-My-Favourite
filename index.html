        <p id="info"> I am 13 years old. My hobby is dancing, as it gives me joy and happiness. I have been learning dancing since I was 6 years old. Dancing unleashes the expressions of my soul. Since my childhood days, I grasped the art of dancing and I still so it today. Dancing is not only an activity; it is a passion for me. I know bharatnatyam (classical dance) and can also perform western dance. I do dancing in my leisure time. Dancing is my way to escape the cruelties of the world. Dancing does not have any age.I will never ever stop dancing and I love it.</p>
